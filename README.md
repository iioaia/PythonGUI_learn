# PythonGUI_learn
Two birds, one stone.

I decided to create a basic calculator which I jokingly named Caculator. This gave me a chance to begin learning about Tkinter for GUI creation and refresh my memory about Functions and variables in Python.

During the tutorial I would often pause and try to work out the next steps on my own. Often with success and a few errors which were corrected and understood as I continued the tutorial.

I found this experience to be very useful at resfreshing my mind and knowledge about Python.

More to come.
